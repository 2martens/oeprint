# Printing Tool

This tool is currently under development for the Orientation Unit of the Computer Science department
of the University of Hamburg. It will be used to reduce the chaos in the days of the printing.

It requires Python 3 and used lpr in the background for print tasks. So it doesn't work on Windows but
who cares.

The tool uses a configuration file to define which builds are available. A sample file can be found under
configuration. The config file is written in JSON which is extremely easy to parse and write. The tool is
accessed via command line and offers an easy to understand interface.
